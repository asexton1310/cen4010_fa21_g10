chatroom.php
	-- checks that a user is a participant of the specified chatroom, if they are not, then they are redirected back to chats.php
	-- only contains a placeholder div, and a list of currently online friends until another user has joined the chatroom
	-- users can invite additional friends to the chatroom

header.php
	-- sends a query that updates the user's lastonline timestamp in online_users table every time they change pages

script_chatroom.php
	-- added removeuser, getparticipants, and closeroom modes that will be called by chatroom.js
	-- removeuser simply deletes the user from this chatroom in chatroom_participants
	-- getparticipants returns a count of the total number of users in this chatroom
	-- closeroom deletes all participants from this chatroom and updates its status to show that it is close

script_getroomstatus.php
	-- queries chatrooms table and returns both the room's status, and html to display in chatroom.php based on the room's status

script_login.php
	-- now also inserts into an entry for this user into online_users table

script_logout.php
	-- removes the user from online_users table

chatroom.js
	-- when chatroom.php loads, this sends a request to getroomstatus.php
	-- assigns a click handler to invite other users regardless of room status
	-- if the room was just created and nobody has joined yet, an interval is set to periodically check the room's status
	-- if the room status becomes 1 when another user joins, then click handlers are assigned to the send message and exit chatroom buttons, an interval is also added that periodically gets the number of participants in the chatroom and closes the room if there are less than 2 participants
