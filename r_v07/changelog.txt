chat.php
	-- displays friends, placeholders for showing online/offline status and sending chatroom invites
	-- clicking the placeholder send invite button redirects to chatroom.php
	-- displays received chatroom invites, buttons to accept and reject invites

chatroom.php
	-- implements the chatroom framework
	-- redirects users back to chat.php when they click the exit chatroom button
	-- checks that users specified a roomid, redirects if they did not
	-- does not check if they are an actual participant in the chatroom yet

chat.js
	-- adds click event handlers to invite user, accept invite, reject invite buttons
	-- sending an invite first creates a chatroom to get a roomid
		-- in its callback, it sends a post request to script_chatinvite.php that updates the database with the invite
		-- callback also sends a post request to script_chatroom.php that adds the sender to the newly created chatroom, where they will wait alone until the recipient joins
	-- accepting an invite sends a post request to script_chatinvite.php that deletes the original invite from the database and updates the chatroom to show that it is active
	-- accepting an invite also sends a post request to script_chatroom.php that adds this user to the chatroom
	-- rejecting an invite sends a post request to script_chatinvite.php that deletes the original invite from the database

chatroom.js
	-- adds click event handlers to the exit chatroom and send message buttons
	-- exit chatroom function is handled inside chatroom.php
	-- send message button posts the roomid and entered message to script_postchat.php
	-- also gets the messages from DB for the current room every 2500ms by sending get request to script_getchat.php
		-- inserts the returned html from script_getchat.php into a holder in chatroom.php's 

script_postchat.php
	-- similar to script_post.php, adds an entry to the chatroom_messages table containing
		-- the user's entered message
		-- the user's userName
		-- the roomid the user is in
		-- an automatically generated timestamp for the message

script_getchat.php
	-- gets all messages for the roomid passed as part of the get request, formats them in HTML and returns this html

script_chatinvite.php
	-- has 3 modes, invite, reject, accept, one of which must be specified in all requests
	-- invite mode inserts into chatroom_requests a chatroom request specifiying the recipient, requestor, and room_id
	-- reject mode deletes from chatroom_requests requests specified by the recipient and requestor
	-- reject mode deletes from chatroom_requests requests specified by the recipient and requestor, as well as updates chatrooms given a specified room_id

script_chatroom.php
	-- has 2 modes, create and adduser
	-- create mode creates a new chatroom with status of 0 and returns the automatically created room_id in the response as a json encoding
	-- adduser mode inserts the currently active user into chatroom_participants given a room_id
